# a simple python script that is compatible with sl4a
# it creates an html project welcome screen,
# saves it to sdcard, then takes a picture on device camera
# next the jpg is sent to a web ocr to translate it to text
# the returned text is spoken by ttsSpeak on the device

# problems:
# image file is too large for web ocr to handle, so
# one needs to zoom in on device camera before 
# taking picture.
# 
# EXIF.py (downloadable, google search it) extracts image
# exif data, particularely the thumbnail data, and saves
# a new, tiny jpg.  unfortunately, this new tiny jpg
# is not a recognizable image to the web service, as it has
# no header data of it's own.  if someone can figure this 
# out, please let me know (ie: add new exif header to
# new tiny jpg file)
# enjoy!
